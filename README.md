# swift-algorithms
a collection of algorithms and data structures written in swift 


## Big O Notation 
The Big O notation is used to classify algorithms according to how their running time or space requirements grow as the input size grows. On the chart below you may find most common orders of growth of algorithms specified in Big O notation.
